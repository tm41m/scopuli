  - name: dim_store
    description: |
      A dimension table containing all relevant attributes of stores. 
  - name: dim_census_division
    description: |
      A dimension table containing all relevant attributes of a Canadian census division.
    columns:
      - name: id
        description: |
          The unique identifier for the census division directly obtained from the `cduid`
          in the statcan source
      - name: census_division_name
        description: |
          This string specifies the census division each store resides in, where each census division is a StatCan-designated geographic subregion.
          The PostGIS extension is used to locate each store within a census division, and this not null test verifies that each store has in fact been
          associated with a census division. The set of all census divisions form a mutually disjoint cover of all of Canada, and hence each store
          should be located within exactly one census division.   
      - name: type
        description: |
          The census division type comes from the Canadian government census definitions.
          This current resource contains only CDR (Census Divisions / de recensement) used
          to establish provincial law and facilitate regional planning. Other valid division
          types include TER (territory), CSD (Census Subdivision), MB (Management Board) etc.

        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['CDR', 'CTY', 'CT', 'TÃ‰', 'MRC', 'UC', 'RM', 'DM', 'DIS', 'RD', 'REG', 'TER']
      - name: land_area
        description: |
          Land area is the area in square kilometres of the land-based portions
          of standard geographic areas. The land area measurements are unofficial
          and are provided for the sole purpose of calculating population density.
      - name: region_code
        description: |
          The two letter international standard denomination for the country's subdivisions established by the ISO-3166-2 code.
          This can be a province, territory, state etc. Uses `raw_region_to_province` macro for parsing of the raw region code.
          If this accepted values test breaks, it means that there was a new region code detected and the logic should be updated
          to handle the new values if possible.
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['NL', 'PE', 'NS', 'NB', 'NB', 'QC', 'ON', 'MB', 'SK', 'AB', 'BC', 'YT', 'NT', 'NU']
