      A dimension table containing all relevant attributes of stores. 
    columns:
      - name: census_division_name
        description: |
          This string specifies the census division each store resides in, where each census division is a StatCan-designated geographic subregion.
          The PostGIS extension is used to locate each store within a census division, and this not null test verifies that each store has in fact been
          associated with a census division. The set of all census divisions form a mutually disjoint cover of all of Canada, and hence each store
          should be located within exactly one census division.   
        tests:
          - not_null
