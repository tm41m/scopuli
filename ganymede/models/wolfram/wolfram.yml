    description: |
      A calendar day timeseries table for product metrics. This table will eventually be a hypercube when additional dimensions are
      injected into the group by statement.
    columns:
      - name: calendar_date
      - name: region_code
        description: |
          The two letter international standard denomination for the country's subdivisions established by the ISO-3166-2 code.
          This can be a province, territory, state etc. Uses `raw_region_to_province` macro for parsing of the raw region code.
          If this accepted values test breaks, it means that there was a new region code detected and the logic should be updated
          to handle the new values if possible.
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['NL', 'PE', 'NS', 'NB', 'NB', 'QC', 'ON', 'MB', 'SK', 'AB', 'BC', 'YT', 'NT', 'NU']
      - name: sum_outside_one_stddev
        description:
          This statistic counts the number of product listings within the specified geographic region (country, province, or census division) whose price on the given day
          is more than standard deviation away from the average of all prices of those products with the same product_id within the corresponding geographic region.
      - name: percent_listings_outside_one_stddev
        description:
          Computed as (sum_outside_one_stddev) / (product_listings)
        tests: 
          - warn_large_values:
              threshold: .25
